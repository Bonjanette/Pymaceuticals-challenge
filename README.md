# Pymaceuticals-challenge
Module 5 Challenge CWRU Data Analytics Bootcamp

The file to be graded is the Pymaceuticals Jupyter notebook, please disregard the file with the "_starter" in the name.

Two data files were merged; summary statistics were generated. Bar, Pie, and Box Plot Charts were created and Quartiles, IQR, and Outliers were found as directed. 

*NOTE*: Code was written such that the Line Plot for a single mouse is generated for a randomly chosen mouse each time that notebook cell is run. To make that plot interactive one could ask the user for a specific mouse and that would be a good user interface feature to have on a summary dashboard, though I'm not clear on how to implement that in a Jupyter notebook. 

A Scatter plot with and without Regression was created; Pearson Correlation was calculated.

For help in completing this assignment, I accessed Python documentation, W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp) for a refresher on for loops, matplotlib documentation, https://sparkbyexamples.com/pandas/pandas-groupby-explained-with-examples/ for review of the groupby structure, and chatgpt for any other commands/methods that I couldn't remember but knew I'd seen but couldn't find quickly in the activities. I also rewatched part of the Module 4 lesson 2 class recording to refresh myself on the use of loc.
